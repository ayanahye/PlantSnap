# Objectives
PlantSnap: Data and Care is a comprehensive plant care and identification tool designed to 
meet the needs of students, gardening enthusiasts, professors, and other researchers in an all-in-one application. Users would be able to search for specific plants and acquire data or have the option to utilize an AI image recognition tool to identify plants. The data returned includes: care guide specifications related to water, sunlight and indoor requirements, and keywords which will be displayed as icons indicating the severity of interacting with this plant. Our project aims to offer a wider range of features compared to existing plant search tools. This will enable researchers, gardening enthusiasts, and other users to find plant data, comparable plants, and other information without needing to search around additional websites.

# Tech Stack
Our group chose to program the project in React.js and style/structure the pages in HTML and CSS. For the designing components of the site, we will utilize Bootstrap to assist with making the design mobile-friendly and responsive. Similarly, we will use the icons and other helpful visuals from Material UI. We chose React.js because it promotes the creation of components that are reusable and smaller compared to using only JavaScript and retaining large files of code. For the testing aspect of our project, we are leaning towards using Jest because it is a popular testing framework for React. Additionally, we would like to use Github Actions as the CI/CD Pipeline since we are all familiar with the GitHub website. For more information about the tech stack please refer to the project report.
